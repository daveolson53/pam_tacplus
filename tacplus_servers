# This is a common file used by audisp-tacplus, libpam_tacplus, and
# libtacplus_map config files as shipped.
#
# Any tac_plus client config can go here that is common to all users of this
# file, but typically it's just the TACACS+ server IP address(es) and shared
# secret(s)
#
# This file should normally be mode 600, if you care about the security 
# of your secret key.   When set to mode 600 NSS lookups for TACACS users
# will only work for tacacs users that are logged in, via the local mapping.
# For root, lookups will work for any tacacs users, logged in or not.

# Set a default connection timeout of 10 seconds, and enable the use of
# poll() when trying to read from tacacs servers.
# Otherwise standard TCP timeouts apply.
# Not set or set to a negative value disables use of poll().
