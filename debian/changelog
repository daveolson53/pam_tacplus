libpam-tacplus (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Added the runtime config capability to include another file, so that

    /etc/tacplus_servers as an include file, and use it in the pam sample config
  * Modified debian packaging to create separate libtac package.
  * Modified to build dev packages for use in other packages
  * Renamed external libtac functions to all have a tac_ prefix, to avoid
    name collision with other programs (the x*alloc family was an issue, in
